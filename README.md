# MusicFetchEngine
This Project is to just play around YouTube data APIs with RESTful client. A RESTful API is created to call YouTube data APIs 
based on the Public key. The AJAX and JQuery combination is used as a client. The AJAX post call will call the RESTful client to return
the videos.

The RESTful API is posted in Google Cloud with Google APP Engine SDK plugin for Eclipse. The link is
